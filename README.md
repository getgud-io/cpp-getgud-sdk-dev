# Development of Getgud C++ SDK

Getgud C++ SDK allows you to integrate your game with the GetGud platform. Once integrated, you will be able to stream your matches to Getgud's cloud, as well as to send reports and update player's data. This is a development repository which contains all our private code for SDK development. This README will include all possible build instructions for different systems. To check all SDK functions and how it works you can visit one of the client repos with the docs.
